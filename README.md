# 🕌 Masjid Management System

A simple, transparent, and audit-ready Masjid Management System
designed for Indian Masjids (100–500 members).

This project focuses on:
- Trust & transparency
- Committee control (not individual control)
- Simple UI for non-technical users
- Stage-wise development
- No payment gateway initially

---

## 🎯 Why This Project?

Most masjids manage:
- Members
- Donations
- Makhtab
- Books & utensils (bartan)

using **manual registers**, which leads to:
- Mistakes
- No audit trail
- Trust issues
- Data loss

This project solves that step-by-step.
